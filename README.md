# Attention, this repo still not finished

  

### I have collected all codes that i write while i've learning JS. Description lines and some variable names are Turkish, excluding examples(apps) 

  

**You can't learn JS from this repo. There's only few comment blocks and example of codes**

  

* I created this repo because when i want to remember something that i worked(studied) before

  

* This is same logic with writing down what you've learned
